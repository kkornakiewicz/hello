A few months ago the European Parliament has voted to end the magical practice of "daylight saving time". Poland is not a country big enough to really need more than one timezone, although outskirts can differ up to one hour between their sunsets and sunrises. I created a simple visualisation to show it will look like when Poland decide which timezone to keep. We have time to decide until April 2020. Central European Time fits better from a geographical point of view, but many of us seem to like summer one more due to longer and brighter evenings.      

Here is a map:
