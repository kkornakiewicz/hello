In 2024, I started walking semi-seriously with the goal of covering every street in Barcelona. I track all my walks with Strava and use Python along with osmnx to process the data and monitor my progress, and deck.gl to visualize progress [here](https://kornakiewi.cz/map/).

As of September, I have walked approximately 1,550 km and completed 45% of all streets (and ramblas, carreteras, places, camins and others).

More technical posts with technical details of tracking, data processing, mapping and putting it all together - is expected to come soon.
