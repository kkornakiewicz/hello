In 2024, I began walking semi-seriously with the goal of covering every street in Barcelona. I track all my walks with Strava and use Python along with osmnx to process the data and monitor my progress.

As of August 18th, I have walked approximately 1,450 km and completed 43% of all streets (and ramblas, carreteras, places, camins and others).
