Hi,  
call me Krzysztof [/[ˈkʂɨʂtɔf]/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Polish).  

I am a software developer and IT consultant, based in Europe.  
I've spent quite a bit of time with Java and other JVM languages.
  
You can catch me [here](https://gitlab.com/pages/hugo) or [here](https://gitlab.com/pages/hugo).
