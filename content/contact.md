Hi,  
call me Krzysztof [/[ˈkʂɨʂtɔf]/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Polish).  

I am a programmer and IT consultant, based in Europe.  
I've spent quite a bit of time solving problems with Java and other JVM languages.

You can catch me [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kornakiewicz/) or [here](https://gitlab.com/krnkcz).  
Preferably, drop me an e-mail: {{< cloakemail "hi@krzysztof.kornakiewi.cz" >}}
